# Vitoconnect for ESPHome

Integration of Viessmann Optolink protocols [GWG], KW and P300 into [ESPHome]. This component is named after the cloud reading unit of Viessmann: Vitoconnect.

## Usage

For usage, simply add the following to your config file. Example: V200WO1.
Address, length and post processing can be retrieved from <https://github.com/openv/openv/wiki/Adressen>. Length of 2 bytes is by default interpreted as int16, 4 bytes as uint32. Both values are then converted to float.

## Per-sensor polling intervals

Both `sensor` and `binary_sensor` accept an optional `update_interval`:

```yaml
vitoconnect:
  uart_id: uart_vitoconnect
  protocol: P300
  update_interval: 30s  # Default for datapoints without their own interval.

sensor:
  - platform: vitoconnect
    name: Thermal heating energy
    address: 0x1640
    length: 4
    update_interval: 5min
    unit_of_measurement: kWh
    filters:
      - multiply: 0.1

binary_sensor:
  - platform: vitoconnect
    name: Compressor running
    address: 0x0480
    update_interval: 10s
```

Intervals must be positive durations in milliseconds or greater; `never` is not
supported. All datapoints are initially due after setup. Each subsequent interval
runs from the last successful enqueue, not from response completion. Sensors
without an override inherit the hub interval. The loop checks due datapoints,
so a 10-second sensor works with a 30-second hub interval.

Only one request per datapoint may be outstanding. Full queues are retried as
space becomes available; datapoints are not silently dropped. Successful replies
and protocol error callbacks both release the pending flag. Missed intervals do
not generate catch-up requests. Communication speed and protocol timeouts can
delay a measurement beyond its configured interval. The scheduler does not change
protocol timeout/recovery behavior; it waits for the protocol callback before
re-enqueueing a pending datapoint. Unsigned elapsed-time arithmetic handles
`millis()` rollover.

Local regression checks: `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` (requires g++).
